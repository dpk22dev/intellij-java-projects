while building project following issues were prevalent

### class file has wrong version 55.0, should be 52.0
dependency mockito was build with java v20 
but my project was using java v8

changed settings in intellij to use v20 globally as well as in project structure.
Not exactly sure how many places i have updated, it might not break other projects

### annotation processor
annotation processor needs to be enabled in intellij to make it work correctly

### second build was very slow, i did below:
increased build heap to 2G
disabled extra extensions in plugins

### bdd
add gherkin, cucumber plugin
stepdefs can be generated by right click and generate stepdef on hovering

### using this project
when copy pasting and opening it as maven project lambok was causing problems
write @NoArgsConstructor hover over red annotaiton and add lombok to classpath by autosuggestion

remove main.java
